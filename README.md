# crystal-d-coding-test
## Preamble
This is the coding test for Crystal D. It is meant to pull in a simple JSON file and render a searchable table using "vanilla" javascript.

## Installation
This code was developed on MacOS using PHP 7.4. It has a minimum requirement of PHP 7.3, 
but should work up and through PHP 8.x (not tested on PHP 8.x).
Goto Github and pull down this code. There are no requirements to use composer or NPM.
```
git clone https://github.com/whitis01/crystal-d-coding-test.git
cd crystal-d-coding-test
php -S localhost:3000
```

## Notes
This code is not extreme tested. If there are issues the author is very sorry :(

## Comments
This code is an attempt to show not only the ability to code in PHP and Javascript, 
but to also show the understanding of how a PHP application should be structured. 
Several things are not fully fleshed out, including composer structure, search functionality
and polymorphism. This is a very simple application that has some extensibility, but 
is not perfect.
